This is a keylogger application that will capture all the keystrokes from the keyboard and mouse.
This application targets the browser where it will locate the file path where the browser stores its cached files and delete the all directories and creates new empty directories so that the user can start from scratch typing in the passwords and login information.
This is done by creating functions that uses the windows SDK that enables us to perform various OS operartions including geting the file paths, read and write operations.
After the login info has been captures, they are saves on a txt file the sent through email.
Currently this application works on Windows only but i'll later develop it to run on Linux and Mac OS.
